# MIPS-Processor-Forwarding
<p align="justify">The MIPS Processor with Forwarding repository is a collection of code and documentation that demonstrates the implementation of a MIPS processor with forwarding techniques to solve data hazards. The MIPS processor is a popular architecture used in many embedded systems and microcontrollers. Data hazards occur when there is a dependency between instructions that requires data to be processed in a specific order. Forwarding is a technique used to avoid data hazards by forwarding data from one instruction to another, without having to wait for the data to be written back to memory.</p>

<p align="justify">This repository includes a Verilog implementation of a MIPS processor that uses forwarding techniques to solve data hazards. The Verilog implementation has been verified using testbenches and simulations to ensure that it works as expected. Additionally, the repository includes documentation that explains the design and implementation of the MIPS processor, including details on how forwarding is used to solve data hazards.</p>

<p align="justify">The MIPS Processor with Forwarding repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about the implementation of a MIPS processor and the use of forwarding techniques to solve data hazards. The code and documentation provided can be used as a reference for building similar systems or as a starting point for further research and development. The repository is open-source, so anyone can contribute to the codebase or documentation and improve upon the implementation.</p>
